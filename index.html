	<div id="div1">
	<p>Reiz is a human spirit from The Under, a place where all human spirits go to receive their afterlife, The Underâ€™s appearance shifts person to person and is mostly based around the religion or culture that they believed in the most. Its actual structure is a cavernous underground layer on the planet.</p>
	<p>Humans have accidently dug into this layer and now The Under has a newly sanctioned area for tourism for the living, which Reiz is a part of.</p>
