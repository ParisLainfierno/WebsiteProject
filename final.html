	<p>Title: The Under Tour <br>
Semester/Year: Fall 2020 <br>
Software: Blender, Photoshop, After Effects<br>
<br><br>
Description: For my last project I wanted to do a video of one of Reiz Charno’s tour through The Under. I knew I would have some difficulty drawing the character and background at the same time, so I decided on making the environment in Blender. I modeled the pillars, found textures for the ground and cave, placed a few lights (setting up 2 to go back and forth to give lighting to the area), and rendered out an animation. For the character I decided on rotoscoping myself to create the animation. It turned out to be quite a time-consuming task, and unfortunately slowed down my project’s process. For the portal I created I decided to use a bottle filled with some water, rotated above a camera. I used the roto brush in After Effects to remove the background from it, added some effects to it to change the coloring and warp it a bit. I then duplicated it, reversed it and scaled it up to be another layer of the portal. The most difficult thing was dealing with render times, having to wait for the blender animation, and the after effects animations slowed down my project progress. I was originally going to have audio of Reiz talking about the tour’s subject but had to cut that for time.
